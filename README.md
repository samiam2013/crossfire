# crossfire

A dumb little project to get AI LLMs to fight one another

needs a `.env` in the root folder, there's an example. 

expects you to run it from the root folder of the repo using `go run .`

requires two keys, for openai and anthropic.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=yourkeyhere
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=yourkeyhere
```
